# Potential Projects
Projects Mr. Mercer is planning to complete. Feel free to ask and inquire about these

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

**Using Project-based Learning to teach Computer Science, Robotics, and Networking hands-on through entertainment, automation, and other applications in a re-vision "Cottage Industry"**

## General Ideas and Concepts of Projects
**1nnov8 Room experienced as a Wellness Center**

Materials should come from salvaged projects

Steps in Design (especially automation)
- Cardboard prototyping with wires and other boxes
- 3D print pieces to improve enclosures, etc.
- Raspberry Pi GPIO IPO with Processing-Java code
- Additional Raspberry Pi and Arduino (Teensy) Projects, like monitor of batteries and wires
- File IO and Server Hosting (GitHub, Google Drive), for example JSON & PWA.

General Ideas
- Some Alberta Education Credits come from Project Credits (within Stream of Project and another at the same level)
- Get students outside the building ... Practicum, Field Trips, Professionals
- Get students outside the computer environment: other computers, businesses, competitions, mentoring

Materials Design
- Use cedar on desk (when wet smells good), idea of being in nature

## Stock Car

## Room, Space, Monitoring for Healthy Learning

General Idea: using a LAN Connected Device monitor CO2 Levels, etc.
- Question: Is room ideal to learn in?
- Research: what are optimal values?

## IoT Plant (Internet of Things), Living Wall Below this

Inspiration: Sea-Can Urban Agriculture (Plug in Power and Water)
- University of Calgary currently installing these in Community Gardens, 20180928

Beginning Plants: Three plants: https://www.today.com/home/3-indoor-plants-actually-clean-air-t100828

### Thoughts to be Organized
- Smallish type box for each classroom, whole school project
- Water bladder to automatically feed plants
- Follow the Twitter (twitterbot)
- Battery Power monitored by Power Meter, DMM?
- Notepad for Podcasts
- Wicking with hydrogen stone does not work the best in dry classrooms, especially in winter months; water from top best for dry rooms

Plant Monitoring (Sensors, Hydroponics?)
- "Water in basin", electrical conductance, shuts off water to feed wicking system
- "Misting Water"

Room Monitoring (especially CO2 for learner awareness)

Alternate "Plant Boxes"
Idea Grow Globe: https://www.designboom.com/design/ikea-space10-the-growroom-flat-pack-spherical-garden-02-20-2017/
- Flower Pot IoT array on Raspberry Pi to JSON to Server
- See Mine Sweeper or Table in File IO

Create Flatbox Shipping and Assembly, with IoT Monitoring

## Living Wall

Random Thoughts
- Automatic Living wall, bladder on gravity to fill pots by wicking, stop water on LED reed switch water conductance
- Living wall on shelf, bladder in bottom, using motor
- Bladder in top for misting and wicking, using gravity
- Businesses buy greens, cottage industry

## Stocking Fish Ponds

Water monitoring

Raise fish from eggs

Sustainable Fisheries: example of maintaining a pond so birds, plants, and other wildlife will maintain healthy fish populations

# Ideas to Include

Physical Computing: Internet of Things Devices (IoT Plant), Autonomous Race Car, Water Monitoring, Weather Monitoring (outdoor), Air Quality Monitoring (indoor)

Outdoor garden and RPi Weather Station

Movie Centre or Battery Recharge Station
- Spin Bikes or under desk bikes to recharge electronics: https://www.treehugger.com/gadgets/pedal-powered-generator-k-tor.html
