## General Ideas and Concepts of Projects
- Some Alberta Education Credits come from Project Credits (within Stream of Project and another at the same level)
- Get students outside the building ... Practicum, Field Trips, Professionals
- Get students outside the computer environment: other computers, businesses, competitions, mentoring


## Stock Car

## IoT Plant (Internet of Things), Living Wall Below this

Inspiration: Sea-Can Urban Agriculture (Plug in Power and Water)
-
Beginning Plants: Three plants: https://www.today.com/home/3-indoor-plants-actually-clean-air-t100828

### Thoughts to be Organized
- Smallish type box for each classroom, whole school project
- Water bladder to automatically feed plants
- Follow the Twitter (twitterbot)
- Battery Power monitored by Power Meter, DMM?
- Notepad for Podcasts
- Wicking with hydrogen stone does not work the best in dry classrooms, especially in winter months; water from top best for dry rooms

Plant Monitoring (Sensors, Hydroponics?)
- "Water in basin", electrical conductance, shuts off water to feed wicking system
- "Misting Water"

Room Monitoring (especially CO2 for learner awareness)

Alternate "Plant Boxes"
Idea Grow Globe: https://www.designboom.com/design/ikea-space10-the-growroom-flat-pack-spherical-garden-02-20-2017/
- Flower Pot IoT array on Raspberry Pi to JSON to Server
- See Mine Sweeper or Table in File IO

## Living Wall

Random Thoughts
- Automatic Living wall, bladder on gravity to fill pots by wicking, stop water on LED reed switch water conductance

## Stocking Fish Ponds

Water monitoring

Raise fish from eggs

Sustainable Fisheries: example of maintaining a pond so birds, plants, and other wildlife will maintain healthy fish populations
